## Flux Composites for multiple CAO events 



> Latent + Sensible + LWout + LWin + SWout + SWin 

> Vertical winds 


- A composite of weak/strong anx/nsa fluxes 
- Anomalies of flux (if the values are very small)

- From where the differences coming from (differences in topography/SST)

- Differences between weak vs strong event 

- Differences in cloud properties
